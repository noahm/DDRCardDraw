## Customizing / Contributing

This app can be easily customized for novel formats a tournament might use. If you have feature requests or ideas, you're welcome reach out on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QPyEATsbP7), [Facebook messenger](https://m.me/noah.manneschmidt), or [on the fediverse](https://mastodon.content.town/@noahm).

If you want to take a stab at developing on the app yourself, you will need have node.js >= 18.0.0 installed along with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Some familarity with React will also help.

Clone this repo to your computer. Then the following commands will be useful:

```sh
# Before running anything else, do this!
# It's a one-time local install of dependencies needed to build the app.
yarn install

# local development will start, with app running at http://localhost:8080/
# edits to the files in ./src/ will automatically reload the browser
yarn start

# if you make changes to any game/song data in ./src/songs/ this will give
# a basic sanity check on the format and contents of it
yarn validate:json

# build a zipped, standalone copy of the app that runs entirely offline,
# jacket images and all! simply unzip somewhere and open index.html
yarn build:zip
```

## Data imports

There are some other useful scripts in `scripts/` that help in maintaining data integrity and pulling in new song data. Several have top-level aliases so you can conveniently update song data: (must have node and yarn installed, and run `yarn install` once, as above)

```sh
# download latest StepManiaX song data and jackets
yarn import:smx

# download latest DDR song data and jackets (blends data from KONAMI official site, 3icecream, RemyWiki and ZIv)
yarn import:ddr

# import an ITG/StepMania song pack into card draw
yarn import:itg path/to/pack/folder some-stub-name

# import the latest Pump it Up data using a data dump found here:
# https://github.com/AnyhowStep/pump-out-sqlite3-dump/
yarn import:pump path/to/pumpout/db
```
